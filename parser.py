# Q:
#   1. how to represent a production tree, with what kind of data structure
#   2. how to adhere each sentential form with a unfinished parse tree
#   3. if hard-code parse tree logic in generate_sentences, they are coupled tightly -> automata
#   4. generate_sentences algrithm is too slow, too memery-eating, and lack further consideration
#       so it is not practical, and may break down in many situations.
